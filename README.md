# Summary of Insights

* In 2020, Elist witnessed a remarkable surge in sales, soaring from $3.2 million in 2019 to $8.6 million by the end of the year, reflecting an astounding 165% increase in sales.
* This substantial growth was mainly driven by explosive sales growth rates of 46% and 50% in February and March 2020, respectively. 
* However, in 2021, signs of deceleration appeared with a 10% decrease in sales growth compared to the previous year. The downward trend continued in 2022, with sales      growth plummeting by 44% and total sales reaching $4.3M, just slightly surpassing $1M above their initial 2019 sales.
    
**Products:**
* The 27in 4k Gaming Monitor, Apple Airpods Headphones, and Macbook Air Laptop emerge as the top three sales-generating products, consistently capturing a significant share of approximately 85-86% of total sales each year from 2019 to 2022.
* Out of these three products, the Apple Airpods Headphones maintain their position as the consistently most popular item.
* Additionally, it is noteworthy that although the Macbook Air Laptop maintains an average order rate of 3%, it boasts an impressive average of 21% of total sales.

**Loyalty Program**
* Over the past two years, specifically in 2021 and 2022, the effectiveness of the loyalty program has been increasingly evident.

# Recommendations
Based on these insights, the team would like to make several recommendations across several areas:

* **Products:**
    * Maximize Macbook Air Laptop Sales Potential: Although the Macbook Air Laptop maintains a relatively lower average order rate of 3%, its impressive contribution of 21% to total sales signifies strong customer demand. To leverage this potential, consider implementing strategies such as bundling offers with complementary accessories, providing attractive financing options, or highlighting unique features to capture a larger market share for the Macbook Air Laptop.
      
* **Loyalty Program:**
    * Expand Program Benefits: Evaluate the existing benefits offered by the loyalty program and consider expanding them to provide additional value to customers. This could include exclusive discounts, personalized offers, early access to new products, or special events. By enhancing the program benefits, you can incentivize customer loyalty and encourage repeat purchases.
      
 * **Operational Effectiveness:**
     * Streamline Operations: Review and streamline your internal operations to ensure efficient order processing, packaging, and shipping. Identify any bottlenecks or areas for improvement in the delivery process and implement measures to increase efficiency. This could involve optimizing inventory management, improving warehouse operations, and enhancing coordination with shipping partners.
       
* **Marketing Channels:**
    * Develop a Social Media Marketing Plan: Create a comprehensive social media marketing plan that aligns with your overall marketing objectives. Define your target audience, select relevant social media platforms, and establish key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the effectiveness of your social media campaigns.
