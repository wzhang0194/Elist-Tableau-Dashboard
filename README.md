# Recommendations
Based on these insights, the team would like to make several recommendations across several areas:

* **Product Sales:**
    * Consider eliminating the Bose headphones and iPhone from the product lineup. These two products have consistently shown low sales figures, with the Bose headphones accounting for only 0.01% of all sales and the iPhone representing a modest 0.73% sales share.
    * By eliminating the Bose headphones and iPhone, the company can focus resources and attention on products like the Airpods and Gaming Monitor, which have shown higher sales figures and potential for growth. This strategic decision may help streamline the product portfolio and allocate resources more effectively.
      
* **Product Orders:**
    * Identify Reasons for Declining Growth: Analyze the reasons behind the negative growth rate observed in 2022. Identify any market trends, customer preferences, or external factors that may have influenced the decline. This analysis will help make informed decisions about future product development, marketing strategies, and potential adjustments to pricing, ensuring sustained growth and adaptability in a changing market.
      
 * **Refund Trends:**
     * Error Detection and Prevention: The complete drop in refunds to zero in 2022 is highly unusual and possibly indicates an error in the data or refund processing. It is crucial to investigate and rectify any system errors or data anomalies promptly. Implement robust error detection and prevention mechanisms to ensure accurate tracking of refund requests and prevent future issues that may impact customer trust and business reputation.
